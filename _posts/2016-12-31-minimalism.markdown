I just finished reading Cal Newport's post
[On Digital Minimalism](http://calnewport.com/blog/2016/12/18/on-digital-minimalism)
which was a very nice outline of what digital minimalism should look like,
though I found it a bit lacking in actual details. The first red flag comes
from the first line of the definition:
> Digital minimalism is a philosophy that helps you question what digital
> communication tools (and behaviors surrounding these tools) add the most
> value to your life.

That is an excellent imact that I am looking for, but not really a description
of what digital minimalism actually is or does. What are the right questions?
How do we measure value?


The core principles do a lot to actually break down what Newport is actually
thinking.

> Missing out is not negative.

This principle discusses how people become exhausted trying to follow many
different sources with the justification that each adds different value.
Newport then argues that one should look at the value gained.
I agree with the underlying idea, but disagree with the title. Missing out on
things _can be_ a negative, there can also be missed opportunites. I believe that
some of the later principles point towards a more interesting concept: some
negatives or misses are acceptable and perhaps even necessary towards getting
the most value.

> Less can be more.

This is where my disagreement with the first principal begins. The idea here
is that focusing on a few things can be much more powerful than focusing on as
many things. Focusing on a few things does not say but implies heavily that
some things are put on the sideline and that is ok because the focused things
will have as much or more impact than the things on the sideline..

> Start from first principles.

Figure out what is most important to you, pick activities that add
significantly to those most important things. Newport contrasts this to
'maximalists' who try to use everything because it all adds value. Figuring
out your core principles is definitely important to determining what is
valuable, but trying to determine what is 'significant value' is still quite
difficult.

> The best is different than the rest.

This principle focuses on how 'the best' medium for something can be
substantially better than and how fulfilling a need is the minimum bar but we
can still find more powerful tools that achieve the same and more. The
example here is a bit weak, showing someone who used twitter to get new news
sources and then questions whether that is worth it. If Twitter is the only
source of that particular news, then comes the question of is the worth it,
which can only be really answered from one's own core principles.

> Digital clutter is stressful.

This is the start of where Newport talks about the cost of maintaining
different accounts across many differents. A short section but one of
the main points to the whole article and really the key difference between
the philosophies of the 'maximalists' and the 'minimalists'. Maximalists
believe that the cost of another activity is small or zero, therefore the
winning tactic is to put a little effort into as many of the most important
activites as possible. Minimalists believe that the cost of another activity
is actually quite large, so large that it can even wipe away the benefit of
another activity. The winning tactic for minimalists is to aim for as few
activites as possible and put much more effort into each. While Newport says
'[this cost] should not be underestimated' I think that even this article does
not emphasis how this difference in measuring cost affects the overall world
view.

> Attention is scarce and fragile.

This principle discusses how there is a total limit to our attention and
also how much work other people put into attracting and keeping attention.
Both certainly worthwhile points to remember and an important reminder to
actually do the analysis to prevent being sucked into someone else's attention
trap.

> Many of the best uses of the online world support better living offline.

This principle is more focused on what sort of things are most valuable,
rather what to do when you know the value of all the things you have.
It is an interesting insight and comes quite naturally when taking a combined
online and offline minimalist approach. What is a great way to reduce your
total number of activites? Combine your online and offline ones!

> Be wary of tools that solve a problem that didnâ€™t exist before the tool.

An important reminder to focus on fixing problems you have and avoid picking
up new problems in the process. I am not convinced of Newport's example of
Snapchat as a tool to fix a problem that did not exist before snapchat existed
as chat has existed for a long time. Ephemeral messages are just a spin on
what SMS and MMS had been able to do for a long time.

> Activity trumps passivity.

This is another principle on what kinds of activites are more valuable than
others. I agree with Newport that building something and fixing a problem is
massively statisfying, but I do think there is a certain amount of passive
information gathering which is more useful than the activity it would replace.
I am not totally sure of this and I am not confident of the mix of this, but
I am confident that 'more activity than passivity' is the right thing.


I enjoyed this article a lot, and I look forward to where Newport goes with it.
The idea of minimalism resonates with me greatly, and this article reminds me
that I should really do something about the seven or so different message
protocols I use. However I think that these principles can be organized in a
more powerful way and this is not quite the manifesto for minimalism, yet. I
hope to reexamine these ideas later and perhaps build on it.
