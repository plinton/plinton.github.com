I recently read [this article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/org-physics-how-triad-structures-allows-companies-absorb-pflaeging?trk=mp-reader-card)
explaining about how leadership and power works in an organization. The key idea
is that there are three structures at work: formal, social (or informal) and value-creation.
Formal would be the tradition organization chart, modelled as a tree where the top level supervises
the next level and and on down. Social would be a network (graph) of people who know each other. 
Value-creation is described as a network (graph) of teams which depend on each other and the article describes
these dependencies based on "reputation" (which sounds like a function of the social graph but that is the
way it is described).
I am actually not sold that there are only three structres (I can believe two of these structures being folded together,
or that there are other, minor, structures at work as well). But the idea of three different ways that power works,
and particularly the idea of a value-creation structure, really resonated with me. In particular it seems to describe
the ways (though not the only ways) that software tools/patterns tend to get adopted:
1) They are pushed by management (formal structure)
2) An individual picks it up because someone they know is using it
3) It is the easiest solution for the current situation


If your boss tells you to use Java, you will probably use Java. If everyone around you is using Ruby, 
you will probably use Ruby. If you want to customize Emacs, you will probably use Emacs Lisp. When I first started
at the Echo Nest, I realized that one of the ways to get things to change was to convince a team lead that my way was
the right way. If it worked, great! If it did mpt work, I could not really do anything. One of the many changes that
happened when I moved to Spotify was that I realized that Spotify did not have formal technical lead roles, but which
meant that many things (I thought) happened by an informal hierarchy. This was a particular challenge for me to work with,
but slowly over time I got better at it. But every so often, someone would just go and build
something and it would get adopted by other teams until it really took hold (see the [Hub Framework](https://github.com/spotify/HubFramework)
for a great example). For an engineer on the low end of the hierarchy without much social capital,
creating value is an excellent avenue for making change. Of course part of the whole point of the article
is that you can use any of these different structures in your company, but using all of them will be most effective.
