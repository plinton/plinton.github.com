I just finished reading [a post on the Farnam Street Blog](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2017/02/cascade-of-sand-complex-systems/)
talking about complex systems. While an interesting post in its own right, it references a
[speech by Friedrich August von Hayek](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1974/hayek-lecture.html)
in which the Nobel Prize winning economist talks about in 1974 how not everything is measurable and knowable,
so one has to work around that. His conclusion follows is as follows:


> If man is not to do more harm than good in his efforts to improve the social order, he will have to 
> learn that in this, as in all other fields where essential complexity of an organized kind prevails,
> he cannot acquire the full knowledge which would make mastery of the events possible. He will therefore
> have to use what knowledge he can achieve, not to shape the results as the craftsman shapes his handiwork,
> but rather to cultivate a growth by providing the appropriate environment, in the manner in which the gardener
> does this for his plants. There is danger in the exuberant feeling of ever growing power which the advance of
> the physical sciences has engendered and which tempts man to try, "dizzy with success", to use a characteristic
> phrase of early communism, to subject not only our natural but also our human environment to the control of a
> human will. The recognition of the insuperable limits to his knowledge ought indeed to teach the student of
> society a lesson of humility which should guard him against becoming an accomplice in men's fatal striving
> to control society - a striving which makes him not only a tyrant over his fellows, but which may well make him
> the destroyer of a civilization which no brain has designed but which has grown from the free efforts of millions
> of individuals.


One the one hand, it is very interesting that Hayek uses the gardaner as an analogy, since Fred Brooks similarly argues that
software should [be grown, not built](http://worrydream.com/refs/Brooks-NoSilverBullet.pdf). On the other hand, perhaps this
is not so surprising since plants and animals are well-known complex systems. The fact that people were discussing this
in 1974 and 1986 suggest that this is a case of "the future is already here â€” it's just not very evenly distributed". Perhaps
other thinkers have already thought more deeply on this?
