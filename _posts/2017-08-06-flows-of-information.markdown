Awhile back I noticed that I was spending a lot of time on reddit and
hackernews. Initially this felt great because I was learning so much from so
many different sources. The commentary was also very useful for me as it occasionally
showed more sides to the conversation than might be in the original article. But I also
began to notice a particular problem: the constant need to check to see if there was anything new.


When I read [an article in wired](https://www.wired.com/story/turn-off-your-push-notifications/)
telling everyone to turn off their push notifications I had mixed feelings. The problem is distraction
as these push notifications can arrive at any time, moving you out of your focus space. While the
distraction hurts productivity, going and checking some sites is
[an] (http://unrealitymag.com/oddly-enough/im-24-hours-sober-from-reddit-and-plan-to-stay-that-way/)
[addicting](http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cyber.2012.0249) behavior that is
similarly destructive to productivity. While leaving these networks all together seems like
the simple solution, there is still a lot that I do on them (at least Facebook, where making events
has had a clear effect on the number of people showing up to them). Instead I am trying to convert
as much of my information as possible to some sort of push notification and then set up periods of
time where I do or do not read them. For making things push notifications, the way I am doing this is
by moving to newsletters in my email. Some daily news, mostly weekly round ups to get a broader sense
of what was important this week rather than every moment of uncertainty. In particular this is about
using [Medium](https://medium.com/),
[Finimize](http://finimize.us10.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&id=ae13866edf&e=9b4c094a1f),
[NPR](http://www.npr.org/about-npr/471757314/newsletters),
[Farnam Street Blog](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/newsletter/) among many others (for another day)
in newsletter form and letting them come to my inbox. To help control when I read them, I am bundling
them in Google Inbox and setting them to only appear once a day, which prevents me from getting distracted
by them in the middle of the day. The other piece is that as I am reading all of these letters
(many of which are just collections of links), I save any interesting articles to
[Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) so that I can pick them up later without stressing about having tons of
tabs open.


Does it work? Seems like it so far, but it needs plenty of tuning. It still requires discipline to actually stick with
it, and I currently have a nasty addiction to [Google News](https://news.google.com) which can cause
distractions. If you think of rivers of information, then Inbox and Pocket are lakes where large
amounts of water gather. But if too much water is coming down the river or the water is not
leaving the lakes quickly enough, then there can be flooding. What the river and lake analogy also
does not cover is that it is important for a well informed individual to have a variety of sources
with different view points, which I do not any real system for. It also means that I will not learn
about any piece of news immediately and some pieces of news will be lost. I have high hopes for it though
once I really stick to it.
