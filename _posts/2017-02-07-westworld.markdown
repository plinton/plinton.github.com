I finally finished season 1 of Westworld, and it was fantastic. However, one
of my favorite parts was the usage patterns of working with the artificial
intelligence. In particular the pattern for "analysis" mode, being able to
inspect the state and reasoning for actions. Westword comes at a time when
there is a lot of struggle with how to explain the choices a machine learning
model makes and the [right to explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08813).
For real, mortal human beings to be able to build the sort of world envisioned
in Westworld, understanding is crucial. It is quite refreshing for a story to
recognize it and build around it. If you asked C-3PO "how did you get those
odds?", he would probably make some snarky joke. Data would probably spew
information. But the debugging tools in Westworld seem very reasonable, as the
characters are able to examine specific queries in a specific mode. These
seem exactly like the kinds of tools to expect in more advance AI/ML systems.
Let us hope that system designers pick up these UX parts for future systems
and not the (*spoiler alert*) human killing parts.
